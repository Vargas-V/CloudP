## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è Today, I decided to do a hands-on project using Terraform. I have been learning how it works and wanted to implement it with AWS. I thought the best first project to do for this would be by making an EC2 instance.

## Prerequisite

‚úçÔ∏è You would need to know the basics of Terraform, such as its commands and the blocks that the AWS provider uses. To find the blocks, you can go to the AWS documentation that Terraform provides to get familiar with ti.

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è (Show-Me) Create a graphic or diagram that illustrates the use-case of how this knowledge could be applied to a real-world project
  (IDK if should do a graph?)
- ‚úçÔ∏è Terraform is a provisioning software that uses IAC. A use case for this is that you wanted to create identical EC2 instances with no errors. Doing it through the console doesn't guarantee that the EC2 instances will be a 1:1 replica. 

## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è Document your trial and errors. Share what you tried to learn and understand about the cloud topic or while completing micro-project.
- While making the EC2 instance, I changed the reigion that Ii wanted to create it in. Expect I had already created the Key Pairs in a different reigion. I also got the AMI id from a different reigion than the one I was trying to upload it to. By doing this, I got errors that my EC2 instance couldn't be formed because ithe AMI ID didn't exist. In reality, it just didn't exist for that reigion specifically.
- üñºÔ∏è Show as many screenshot as possible so others can experience in your cloud research.
